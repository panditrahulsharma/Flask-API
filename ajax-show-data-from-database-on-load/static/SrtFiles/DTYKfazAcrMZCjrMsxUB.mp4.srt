00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.540
hi, everyone. So this syriza videos is going

2
00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.050
to be going over a Web framework technology called Django

3
00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:13.419
. So Django is this thing which essentially allows you

4
00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.779
to make dynamic websites. Now. What that means

5
00:00:15.779 --> 00:00:19.440
is we could make websites now through Django that will

6
00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.530
allow us to store things in a database load pages

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.670
dynamically based on what's in the database, and also

8
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.289
do a lot of different cool things in terms of

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.590
making an actual living breathing website. In the previous

10
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.479
Siri's, we made static websites using just HTML,

11
00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:39.000
CSS and JavaScript. Those were all front and technologies

12
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.619
that run in the browser. Django is a Web

13
00:00:41.619 --> 00:00:44.630
server built on python, which will be running in

14
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.649
a server and basically handling requests to our website.

15
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.750
So this will make a lot more sense once we

16
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.049
actually get into it. But remember, from our

17
00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:57.750
howto how the Internet works lecture that basically, when

18
00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.689
someone goes to a website, it takes the Europa

19
00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.969
and basically makes a request to that girl to the

20
00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.349
Web server. The Web server is basically, um

21
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.170
, what we're gonna be writing using Django. You

22
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.099
might have heard of some different technologies such as ruby

23
00:01:14.099 --> 00:01:18.430
on rails or maybe no Js those air. Essentially

24
00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.909
other Web frameworks for B is ruby on rails is

25
00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.099
Britain, and Ruby Note is Britain and JavaScript and

26
00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:26.730
Python is the Web frame where Django is the Web

27
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.209
framework. Python is written, written in Python.

28
00:01:30.739 --> 00:01:34.569
There's also something called Flask, which is essentially a

29
00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.540
more lightweight version of it. But Django is the

30
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.219
one I like to use, because once you know

31
00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:40.670
how to use it, it provides a lot of

32
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.599
powerful functionality right out of the box. The thing

33
00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:45.340
is, is that it's actually a little bit of

34
00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.010
a challenge to learn if you don't have someone guiding

35
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.870
you through the process. So that's kind of the

36
00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.810
goal of these videos for me, because when I

37
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.459
tried to learn Django, it took me basically like

38
00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.930
five failed attempts, and I kept trying to learn

39
00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.620
and trying to learn it never got it, until

40
00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.170
finally someone helped me learn on an internship that I

41
00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.030
did. So hopefully through these videos, you'll be

42
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.549
able to get that initial push that you need to

43
00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.639
really understand what's going on in order to cheque out

44
00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.150
Jango. Just it's spelled like this deejay angio.

45
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.669
If you type it in, then first thing we

46
00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:21.430
get is Django the Web framework for something or the

47
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.629
other perfectionists with the deadline, I would not call

48
00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.639
myself a perfectionist, but I do have deadlines.

49
00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:30.789
So this makes sense. Um, as you can

50
00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:32.090
see, it has stuff you can download it.

51
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.699
Love of law. So on. So, yeah

52
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:38.650
, Next videos, we're gonna be talking about basically

53
00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:40.969
building a website using Django, and we'll be building

54
00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:44.759
a specific type of website, um, to kind

55
00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.620
of guide our discussion through the features that Django has

56
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.889
. And the great thing is that once you learn

57
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.849
one web framework like Django, it's then really easy

58
00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:53.789
to learn other ones, like Ruby on Rose or

59
00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:58.020
tto learn no Js or to learn flask. Because

60
00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.409
all of those web frameworks all any Web framer really

61
00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:02.870
has, like, a set of specific things that

62
00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.490
it has to do a set of core functionalities.

63
00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:07.120
And once you know what those are, you know

64
00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.759
what to look for in a new one that you

65
00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:10.949
don't know. So it becomes a lot easier to

66
00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:14.129
pick them. So hopefully, by learning how to

67
00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:15.710
build with Django, you'll actually be well equipped to

68
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.949
do a lot of different things using Web development.
