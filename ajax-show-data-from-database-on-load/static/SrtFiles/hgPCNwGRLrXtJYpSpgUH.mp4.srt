1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.310
or writing guys get ready for the best Django tutorials

2
00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:11.380
areas in the entire universe. So first things first

3
00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.910
. What is Django exactly? Well, it's a

4
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.000
Web application framework built with python on a Framework is

5
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.429
basically a collection of modules. Pre written codes help

6
00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:24.100
with a particular task. On Jang Go's case,

7
00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.719
that task is building a Web up. So rather

8
00:00:27.719 --> 00:00:31.239
than creating a full Web application from absolute scratch ourselves

9
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.420
using python trying to reinvent the wheel, we can

10
00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.549
instead harness the power of the jungle framework to help

11
00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:40.869
us out with things like user authentication, template in

12
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.109
routing and much, much more. So basically,

13
00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:47.500
my Friends Jungle allows us to easily create dynamic Web

14
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.759
ups using python. Now imagine this scenario. We

15
00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:53.740
have our client eyebrows over here, and we want

16
00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.619
to make a request in this browser to a particular

17
00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.039
profile page on a Web site. So we got

18
00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.469
to my app dot com forward slash profile. Now

19
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.750
this website is be empowered by Django on the servant

20
00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.920
. So over here on the service is where Django

21
00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:07.799
is going to do all of its magic and really

22
00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.730
help us out. So Jungle receives this request right

23
00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.719
here, looks at it and says, Okay,

24
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.370
well, I know that you need to now communicate

25
00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.290
with database to grab information for this profile, so

26
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.230
I'll help you do that. Jungle helps us with

27
00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.290
this. Then it retrieves that data and says,

28
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.569
Right, What do you want to do with it

29
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:27.090
? You want to stick it into a hasty Mel

30
00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.310
template? No problem. I'll help with that as

31
00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.950
well. So it does that and sends that to

32
00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.069
the browser to It helps with all of this kind

33
00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:38.390
of service, and magic over here really makes creating

34
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.200
a Web application really simple. All right, And

35
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.879
so throughout this series will be using jungle to create

36
00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.140
this block from the ground up. And along the

37
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.840
way, we're gonna learn about a lot of different

38
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.019
things, such as user authentication to implement some kind

39
00:01:52.019 --> 00:01:53.409
of logging sign up system. We'll take a look

40
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.200
at jangle farms as well lost. Lots of other

41
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.579
different things, such as routing the jungle, are

42
00:02:00.579 --> 00:02:04.760
M TEM plating and tonnes more so another good reason

43
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.629
to use Jango is because the jungle documentation is really

44
00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:09.740
, really good. It's seconds it on whenever you

45
00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.930
want to search for for example forms. It's gonna

46
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.460
have something to do with that on the documentation,

47
00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.379
in fact, loads to do with that so you

48
00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:17.979
can just click on whatever you like. I was

49
00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:21.810
gonna give you loads of different examples and many tutorials

50
00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.159
. Almost. Okay, so I would highly employ

51
00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.650
you to cheque this out. If you do get

52
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.229
stuck on something, I'll leave the link down below

53
00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.699
. Now, as always, are giving you all

54
00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:31.669
of the course files for this Siri's. You can

55
00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.680
find them on my Gig Harbour Repo Jungle Playlist.

56
00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:38.229
The link is gonna be down below on DH.

57
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.780
I've doing a different branch for each different lessons.

58
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.539
So if you want to see the code for lesson

59
00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:44.409
five, for example, you need to select the

60
00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:46.810
lesson five brunch and you can find all the cold

61
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.050
inside hit. All right, So just a couple

62
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.490
more things I am gonna be using Atom for this

63
00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:54.289
Siri's. It's a really cool free text editor.

64
00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:57.150
So I employ you to download that as well.

65
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.069
You can find it at atom dot I hope I'm

66
00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.789
also gonna be using Cmdr. Or Commander that is

67
00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.810
a consul emulator for Windows. You don't have to

68
00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.800
use this idea because I think it's quite cool.

69
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.069
But if you prefer to use the default on Windows

70
00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:12.650
one automatic one, that's absolutely fine as well.

71
00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.460
Now, because jungle uses python, you will need

72
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.030
python installed on your computer Before you start this.

73
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.259
Siris on DH probably advise you to learn a little

74
00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:24.539
bit about the python basics before you start this Siri's

75
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.419
as well. So if you want to do that

76
00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.560
, you want to cheque out my python three tutorial

77
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.430
for beginners. Siri's I'm gonna Leave the Link Down

78
00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:34.289
below. That shows you how to instal Python along

79
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:36.240
with a lot of the basics of python as well

80
00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:38.120
, and that is going to give you a good

81
00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.150
base work for the rest of this series right here

82
00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.879
. So now we've got that out of the way

83
00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.139
. Let's crack on and start created this block with
