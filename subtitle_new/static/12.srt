1
00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.839
So here three scenarios. One where the data lives

2
00:00:02.839 --> 00:00:05.379
on the line. Like this one with data literally

3
00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:07.809
comes from a circle like that in a kind of

4
00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:11.169
very equal distribution in the X and Y axis.

5
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.130
In one way, the data for the vertical and

6
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.280
I'm gonna ask a couple of two of false questions

7
00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:20.899
here. First one, just the principal component analysis

8
00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.980
return a result yes or no for either of these
